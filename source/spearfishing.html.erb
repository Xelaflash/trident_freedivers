      Want to spear your own fish for dinner? <br />
      Coastal spearfishing is a great activity in sustainability and selective fishing while enjoying the marine
      environment and exploring the reefs of beautiful Barbados. <br />
      <strong class="yellow-highlight"
        >This tour requires no prior experience in spearfishing you just need to be in good health and be a confident
        swimmer!</strong
      >
      <br />
      The cost per person for the coastal spearfishing tour is $110 USD ($220 BBD) and includes all gear, instruction
      and safety demonstration and guidance. There is also an option to add Gopro footage of the tour for an additional
      $20 USD.
    </p>
    <p class="description-text">
      Usually we will pick you up or meet up at a designated location. I will teach you some basic breath hold and
      equalization techniques, go over the safety information briefing, teach you about a variety of Spearguns, pole
      spears and spearfishing equipment as well as tips for getting closer to fish and spotting the target species.
      <br />
      We target everything from lobster, lionfish, barracuda, mackerel and snappers. <br />
      We will get geared up and swim out from the beach. <br />
      Afterwards I will show you how to fillet the fish and we can all have hot tea and a snack on the beach. <br />
      The tour is about 4 hours total (this may vary depending on where you are staying as pick up times may vary).
      <br />
      Tour options are available- Morning tours 9am-1pm or Afternoon Tours 1-5pm. Both are productive however lionfish
      are often spotted around sunset and so the afternoon tours tend to have more yield in lionfish.
    </p>
    <p class="description-text">
      Blue water tours targeting pelagic fish are available year round. Barbados being an Atlantic Island there are
      always opportunities for targeting larger fish offshore. <br />
      <strong class="yellow-highlight">This tour can only be booked by experienced spearos</strong>. <br />
      Included is ice, bait and flasher. Full spearfishing gear is also available for use however many people prefer to
      bring their own guns and equipment with them. <br />
      The guns available for blue water use are Rob Allen 130 set up with break away spear, float line and pressurized
      float. <br />
